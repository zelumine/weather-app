This weather app was made for a technical test.

I had to use OpenWeatherApp's API to get the forecast information, with a local .json file including the French cities.

I had to show today's weather and the forecast for the next three days.
For the next three days' min and max temperatures I took the lowest and highest. For the weather icon I chose to show the weather at 12pm.
